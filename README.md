AirBnB Clone Project Overview
Project Overview:

In this project, we will replicate the console functionality of the AirBnB Clone Project.

Our main objective is to develop a command interpreter to effectively manage our AirBnB objects.

To accomplish this, we will:

Establish a parent class (BaseModel) responsible for initializing, serializing, and deserializing future instances.

Implement a streamlined process of serialization and deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> File.

Define all classes essential for AirBnB functionality (such as User, State, City, Place...) inheriting from the BaseModel.

Create the foundational storage engine for the project: File Storage.

Develop comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality of all classes and the storage engine.

Key Features of our Command Interpreter:

Ability to create new objects (e.g., a new User or a new Place).

Retrieve objects from various sources such as files or databases.

Perform operations on objects (e.g., counting, computing statistics).

Update attributes of existing objects.

Delete objects from the system.
